- Arrays  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- File Handling (if applicable)  
- Other related exercises

## Purpose
This repository will serve as my **personal learning archive** to document my progress, strengthen my coding foundation, and prepare for future programming challenges.

## Semester
1st Semester – Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)**
